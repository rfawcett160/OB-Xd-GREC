# OB-Xd-GREC


# About
OB-Xd-GREC is a fork of DiscoDSP's OB-Xd 2.10 Release. The ultimate goal of this repository/project is to preserve the 2.10 source code as it was prior to DiscoDSP's decision to close the source code for OB-Xd. Any binaries/plugins created by myself WILL NOT have any restrictions placed on the end user. Unlike other so called "FREE" synth plugins, this synth can be used freely for both non-commercial and commercial purposes.

What is/was OB-Xd?

OB-Xd is based on the [Oberheim OB-X](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberheim_OB-X). It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design. OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound.

While not copying originals, some of the features were taken to a better point. Continuous blendable multimode filter (HP-Notch(BP)-HP in 12 dB mode and 4-1 pole in 24 dB mode). Also, like many synths of the OB-X's generation, the OB-Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.

Thanks to [2Dat](https://github.com/2DaT/Obxd) for the original OB-Xd and Soshi Studio for giving the rights to continue this wonderful product. Thanks to [reales](https://github.com/reales/OB-Xd) for his development of OB-Xd up until version 2.10. 

# Binaries

Binaries will be released once I get this project up and running. My primary focus will be to ensure that the Linux Plugins will be made avaialble and easily portable from one Debian based system to another. After this is done, I will then begin work on making Windows Plugins. 

# Building

Source code can be compiled with [JUCE 7.0.12](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/releases/tag/7.0.12).

QuickAndDirtyGREC Theme was made using some of [gitterdude's](https://github.com/gitterdude) contributions to [OB-Xx](https://github.com/pauloesteban/OB-Xx) by [pauloesteban](https://github.com/pauloesteban). Specifically, gitterdude's 'coords.xml' was used for placement of the various knobs and buttons on the main interface. All graphics were designed by myself from within the [GNU Image Manipulation Program] (https://www.gimp.org/). As a result, QuickAndDirtyGREC will be released under the same Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license since gitterdude's theme was used as a template for the QuickAndDirtyGREC Theme. Many thanks to gitterdude for the creation of the [OB-Xx](https://github.com/pauloesteban/OB-Xx) theme.
